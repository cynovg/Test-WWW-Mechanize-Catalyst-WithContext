=head1 NAME

Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::WithContext - T::W::M::C can now give you $c

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::WithContext;

    my $mech = Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::WithContext->new( catalyst_app => 'Catty' );

    my ($res, $c) = $mech->get_context("/"); # $c is a Catalyst context
    is $c->stash->{foo}, "bar", "foo got set to bar";

    $mech->post_ok("login", { u => "test", p => "secret" });
    my ($res, $c) = $mech->get_context("/");
    is $c->session->{stuff}, "something", "things are in the session";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::WithContext is a subclass of L<Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst>
that can give you the C<$c> context object of the request you just did. This is useful for
testing if things ended up in the stash correctly, if the session got filled without reaching
into the persistention layer or to grab an instance of a model, view or controller to do tests
on them. Since the cookie jar of your C<$mech> will be used to fetch the context, things
like being logged into your app will be taken into account.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 get_context($url)

Does a GET request on C<$url> and returns the L<HTTP::Response> and the request context C<$c>.

    my ( $res, $c ) = $mech->get_context('/');

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following section gives a few examples where it's useful to have C<$c>.

=head2 Are we loading the right template?

If the content that comes out of your application does not really contain any distinct markers
it's very hard to check if the right stuff got rendered. Instead of trying to find something
in your HTML that helps you identify the right page with one of the content checking methods like
C<content_like>, you can just look at the template name in the stash. Of course that doesn't tell
you if it got rendered successfully, but it does tell you which template the controller decided
should be rendered.

    my ( $res, $c ) = $mech->get_context('/hard/to/verify/page);
    is $c->stash->{template}, 'hard_to_verify.tt2', 'the right template got selected';

=head2 Checking what's in the Session without talking to the store

If you want to look at values in the session before and after some action, you would typically
go and connect to the session store and peek around. For that, you need to know the type of the
store, how to connect to it, and your current test user's session id. This is relatively trivial
if a database (e.g. with L<Test::DBIx::Class>), but gets more complicated when you're not mocking
the store and it's something a little more esoteric. Of course you could use a different store for
your unit tests, but maybe you don't want to do that.

Enter Test::WWW::Mechanize::Catalyst::WithContext. Just grab the context before and after you
perform your action and look at the sessions.

    # we don't need the response object for this request
    (undef, my $c_before) = $mech->get_context('/'); # or some other url
    my ( $res, $c_after ) = $mech->get_context('/change/session');
    isnt $c_before->session->{foo}, $c_after->session->{foo}, 'foo got changed';

Of course this could be arbitrarily complex.
